If you check it out via my affiliate link, it helps support the channel (I may earn a small commission): https://superwhisper.com/?via=patrick\n\nThis video reveals the single biggest front-end workflow unlock our team has discovered: using the Playwright MCP to give Claude Code vision. I'll show you how to set up an orchestration layer that allows Claude Code to control the browser, take screenshots, and iteratively self-correct its own designs, turning it into a pixel-perfect design partner.\n\nI break down my exact Claude Code workflow, including high-level principles, my claude.md file, custom subagents for design reviews, and powerful slash commands that create an agentic loop for incredible results.
