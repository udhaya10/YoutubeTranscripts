This video goes through configuring and setting it up, and how the router works as a local Express server intercepting Claude Code requests. \n\nWhile other models don't perform as well as Claude's native models with the platform, Claude Code Router provides a clever workaround for developers wanting to experiment with different AI providers while maintaining access to MCP servers, tools, and custom slash commands.\n\n🔗 Relevant Links\nClaude Code Router - https://github.com/musistudio/claude-code-router\n\n❤️ More about us\nRadically better observability stack: https://betterstack.com/\nWritten tutorials: https://betterstack.com/community/\nExample projects: https://github.com/BetterStackHQ\n\n📱 Socials\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/betterstackhq\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/betterstackhq/\nTikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@betterstack\nLinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/company/betterstack",
