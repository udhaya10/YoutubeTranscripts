## Description

Claude Code Router let's you to use Claude Code's powerful features with different AI models like GPT-4.1, Gemini 2.5 Pro, and local models like Llama and DeepSeek. This video goes through configuring and setting it up, and how the router works as a local Express server intercepting Claude Code requests. 

While other models don't perform as well as Claude's native models with the platform, Claude Code Router provides a clever workaround for developers wanting to experiment with different AI providers while maintaining access to MCP servers, tools, and custom slash commands.
